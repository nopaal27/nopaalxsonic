        <h2>Sonic Description</h2>
        <p>Not much is known about Sonic's early life. What is known is that he was born on Christmas Island on June 23rd with the ability to run at super speeds, but his love of adventure quickly led him to leave his home. Under unknown circumstances, he met Dr. Ivo Robotnik, aka Eggman, and the two became enemies. He would then continue to battle the evil scientist in countless battles Sonic along with his friends defeats and protects the world from foes that come their way</p>
        <p>Sonic is often described as confident, cocky, and sassy, but also kind and genuine. He dislikes showing vulnerability and can be a bit awkward with emotions. He's a thrill-seeker who loves adventure and exercise.
